due to missing the shift from classroom bio- assignment to homework bio-assignment
Changed to this project at the end of Wednesday's class
Eventually deduced that even though the names referenced in the instructions were the same as HTML terms, this was not 
necessarily germane to the homework. (perhaps intentionally identical terms, hoping to force thinking in logical 
rather than literal terms???)

dozend and even 100s of brute force changes in CSS, along with judicious use of a few examples in class ("clear:both", float: left /right, 
differences among padding, border & margin & the complex math this induces, advantage of percentage vs literal px values)
eventually led to a decent reproduction of the example "HW-wireframe."

time permitting, the CSS can certainly be simplified & still give acceptable results.  Likewise comments will hopfully still be added, 
but given the specficity of the instructions and simplicity of the exercise, there is not much to explain.
